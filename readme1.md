# The mthree banking group project 

## Aim of this repoitory
This repository was for Students at the Open University to work together to come up with stratagies to improve the digital and customer experiance of a maid up bank (mthree).

The Students met regularly over a 2 week period to come up with research points and to present their findings in a show and tell at the end of the 2 weeks. 

## Initial plans 
The initial plans was to complete all reasearch in the first week and to work on a simple demo of a banking app that would showcase some of our findings. 

## Conclusion
The team worked very hard in producing research and collaborating to create a presentation for the "Show and Tell". 
However, due to unforseen circumstances the team ran behind on the initial plan. The team have produced a presentation to present at the "Show and Tell" event. However, there was not enough time to produce a simple banking app to showcase some of our research. 

As the Reposotory Owner, I would like to thank the Open Univeristy Careers and Employability Service for giving me the great opertunities with working with our partners (mthree) and also for giving me the great experiance of working with a fantastic group of students.
